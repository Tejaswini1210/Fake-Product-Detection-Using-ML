CONCLUSION

FUTURE SCOPE
•  Support for Additional Languages and Dialects
Expand the system to include more spoken languages and regional dialects, along with their respective sign language variants.
•  Emotion and Tone Recognition
Enhance the system’s capability to interpret emotions and tonal nuances in speech, allowing for more expressive and context-aware sign language gestures.
•  Integration with Wearable Technology
Implement the system in wearable devices like AR glasses or portable units to make the solution more accessible and practical for everyday use.
•  Bidirectional Communication
Incorporate a sign-to-speech feature, enabling individuals who are deaf to communicate with non-signing individuals more effectively.
•  Offline Functionality
Develop an offline version of the system to ensure accessibility in areas with limited internet connectivity.
•  AI-Based Learning and Updates
Utilize artificial intelligence to improve the system’s adaptability and accuracy through continuous learning and user feedback.
